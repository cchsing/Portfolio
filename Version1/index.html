                    Hi, I'm <span>Chong Chia-Hsing (Justin).</span> 
                    An Associate Consultant (Splunk Expert)
                </h1>
                <p>
                    I'm a developer and problem solver. I'm currently being employed as an Associate Consultant 
                    at <a href="https://www.isatec.com">Isatec Sdn. Bhd.</a> for providing consultation and IT
                    SLA support for customer in relation to Splunk APM software system. My previous employments 
                    as Equipment Engineer and System Engineer at <a href="https://sunpower.maxeon.com">Maxeon Solar Technologies</a> and
                    <a href="https://www.sermax.my/">Sermax Sdn. Bhd.</a> also allow me to adopt the skills and knowledge
                    for PLC and SCADA programming in industrial automation by being a project developer, deployer, and tester.

                    <p>
                        Engineer with knowledge and experience in PLC and SCADA programming for industrial
                        automation. As a result of the job requirement as a system engineer, practical experience
                        had been gained for algorithm design (Control Logic) and features creation (Graphics)
                        in liaison with the customer or end user for the projects. Furthermore, commissioning,
                        deployment, and technical documentation for the success of the projects are to be
                        expected from my position as the developer of the automation program. Currently, my job as
                        an equipment engineer requires me to have project management skills with the capability
                        to liaise between different departments for the setup of the AGV system. It also requires me
                        to liaise with vendors from China to achieve the project goal where technical
                        communication is a challenge with the technical terms used in Mandarin.

                        Personal growth is vital for social mobility with my attempts at website development
                        related skills. These skills are the HTML, CSS, and Javascript programming languages
                        mastery. On top of the basic languages, front-end framework, Angular, Node.js, and 
                        PHP Laravel are explored with future plans for back-end related exploration and  development.

                        My physics knowledge and skills gained from degree education also prepared me for
                        a potential research-based position. In addition, it also helps me to be a good problem
                        solver as evidenced by the projects done during my position as system engineer for
                        industrial automation.
